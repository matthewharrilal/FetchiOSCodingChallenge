 * This protocol lets you know when meal thumbnails have been fetched.
 *
 * When the `MealsManager` grabs a thumbnail image for a meal, it will notify the delegate through this method.
 * The `@MainActor` attribute makes sure that everything runs on the main thread, so it's safe for UI updates.
 *
 * - Note: Any class that adopts this protocol should be ready for multithreading, especially if itâ€™s updating the UI.
