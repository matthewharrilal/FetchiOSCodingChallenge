# FetchiOSCodingChallenge
Recipe Explorer - iOS Coding Challenge  This iOS app allows users to browse dessert recipes from TheMealDB API. It displays a list of meals, sorted alphabetically, and provides details like instructions and ingredients. The app uses Swift Concurrency (async/await) and filters out null or empty values for clean presentation.
